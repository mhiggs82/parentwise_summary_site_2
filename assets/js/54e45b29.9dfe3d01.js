A child with a high IQ may still fail if they cannot manage their time, impulses, or emotional reactions. EF allow us to focus, hold information in mind, and shift our thinking as needed. Galinsky argues that these skills are like a muscle: they are not fixed at birth and can be systematically strengthened through specific types of play and interaction."}},{"heading":"2.

Children build this cognitive flexibility by engaging in activities that require them to \'stop, think, and act\' rather than just reacting to every impulse. Protecting a child\'s focus by limiting background stimulation (like irrelevant TV) is critical for neural development."}},{"heading":"3.
