This creates a scarcity mentality. By giving according to individual need (\'You need new shoes; your brother doesn\'t\') and acknowledging unique traits, you create a sense of abundance and security that reduces the need for constant comparison."}},{"heading":"2.

This denial of feeling makes the child feel even more misunderstood and resentful. Acknowledging the feeling\u2014\'Sometimes you feel really frustrated living with him\'\u2014allows the emotional charge to drop.

These labels become self-fulfilling prophecies. To free a child, parents must aggressively notice and describe behavior that contradicts their \'assigned\' role.
