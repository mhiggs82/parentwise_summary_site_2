The book addresses what Moyer calls a \\"crisis of kindness\\" in modern society, arguing that raising kind, resilient, honest children requires deliberate effort grounded in developmental psychology research rather than intuition or popular parenting myths. Moyer synthesizes over 20 years of developmental psychology research into practical, non-judgmental guidance that challenges widely-held assumptions\u2014such as colorblind parenting, rewards-based motivation systems, and punitive discipline\u2014while acknowledging the complexity of modern parenting pressures. Unlike prescriptive parenting manuals that offer one-size-fits-all solutions, Moyer\'s approach recognizes nuance and context, helping parents interpret research findings and apply them to their unique family situations. Raise children who are kind, resilient, honest, equitable, and capable of navigating complex social and moral landscapes\u2014not through perfection, but through consistent, compassionate guidance grounded in how children\'s brains actually develop. The book aims to equip parents with both the \\"why\\" (research-backed principles) and the \\"how\\" (concrete strategies) for fostering character traits that matter in an increasingly complex world."},"tabs":{"analysis":[{"heading":"1.
