While the capacity for spiritual connection is 1/3 genetic and 2/3 environmental, it behaves like a \'use-it-or-lose-it\' faculty. If the spiritual \'muscle\' is not exercised through practice and validation during childhood, the neural pathways associated with transcendent connection can atrophy, leaving the child less resilient in the face of existential stress."}},{"heading":"2. The \'Nod\' of Intergenerational Transmission","intro_text":"Spirituality is most effectively transmitted through the relational bond of unconditional love between parent and child.","insight_card":{"title":"The Power of the Nod","icon":"fa-solid fa-people-arrows","text":"The research shows a staggering 80% protective effect against depression when a parent and child share a spiritual orientation. This transmission occurs through \'the nod\'\u2014the moment-to-moment validation of a child\'s spiritual experiences by an adult they love. When a parent explicitly shares their own spiritual values and practices, they create a shared \'Field of Love\' that serves as a neurological anchor for the child\'s own developing spirit."}},{"heading":"3.

Miller reframes adolescent depression not as simple pathology, but as an existential quest for answers to \'the big questions.\' If parents and communities provide a spiritual framework for these questions, the \'crisis\' becomes the gateway to lifelong resilience rather than a descent into chronic mental illness."}},{"heading":"4.

A \'severed spirit\' occurs when children are taught to ignore their own intuitions and transcendent experiences in favor of performance and logic.
