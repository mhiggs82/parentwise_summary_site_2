Written by a leading expert in cyber-addiction, this guide provides the technical and psychological strategies needed to win the \'digital arms race\' against savvy teens. By controlling the infrastructure and implementing the 24-hour maximum penalty rule, you can restore balance to your home without the constant physical power struggles over devices."},"tabs":{"analysis":[{"heading":"1. The 5 Developmental Domains","intro_text":"Don\'t measure digital health in hours; measure it by the impact on real-world functioning.","insight_card":{"title":"Functional Impact Assessment","icon":"fa-solid fa-stethoscope","text":"The danger of screens is found in what they displace. Assess your child across five domains: 1) Social (withdrawing from real friends), 2) Educational (dropping grades), 3) Behavioral (aggression upon removal), 4) Emotional (mood dependent on the game), and 5) Physical (health/sleep). If these domains are declining, your child\'s \'Tech Diet\' is out of balance and requires clinical-level intervention."}},{"heading":"2.

Instead, treat it like a salary. Just as an adult doesn\'t get paid if they don\'t show up to work, a child shouldn\'t get Wi-Fi if they don\'t meet their real-world responsibilities (school, chores, sport). When screens are \'earned\' through functional behavior, the power dynamic shifts from parent-control to child-responsibility."}},{"heading":"3.

A 24-hour maximum penalty ensures that every day represents a fresh start and a new chance to earn access.
