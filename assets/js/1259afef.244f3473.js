By shifting from constant rescue to an atmosphere of grace, parents can create a home where anxiety is processed without shame and identity is secured in character rather than grades."},"tabs":{"analysis":[{"heading":"1.

Shifting identity to \'unconditional acceptance\' allows them to function from a place of security, which, paradoxically, often leads to better performance due to reduced pressure."}},{"heading":"2.
