Withdrawal and distance-seeking, while painful, signal healthy development rather than parental failure."}},{"heading":"2. From Pathology to Development","intro_text":"Behaviors typically viewed as problematic\u2014eye-rolling, withdrawal, moodiness\u2014are reframed as evidence of healthy developmental progress. This shift from deficit-based to growth-based thinking fundamentally changes parent-teen dynamics through understanding the veil of obedience concept.","insight_card":{"title":"The Veil of Obedience","icon":"fa-solid fa-lightbulb","text":"Girls appear to listen while actually disengaging when adults lecture, take suspicious tones, or level moral judgments.

Emotional intelligence requires practice with competing mental states in safe relationships where repair is possible.","insight_card":{"title":"The Repair Process","icon":"fa-solid fa-lightbulb","text":"After conflicts, acknowledge both perspectives, explain your mental state, invite reflection on hers, apologize when appropriate, and avoid shame.
