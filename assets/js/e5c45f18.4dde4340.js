fingers up away from the thumb to show how the Owl flies away when the Dog starts barking too loudly at perceived threats."},{"bold_title":"PRACTICE the neutral state","description":"Have your child fold their fingers over their thumb to represent a \'Safe Brain\' where the Owl is hugging the Dog and making good choices."},{"bold_title":"USE non-verbal check-ins","description":"During tricky moments, simply show the hand model to ask your son where his brain is without using triggering verbal \'lectures\'."},{"bold_title":"MODEL the lid flip","description":"Show your own \'flipped lid\' when you feel frustrated, demonstrating that all humans (even adults) have a Dog that occasionally gets loud."},{"bold_title":"RESPECT the flipped state","description":"Agree that once a \'lid is flipped,\' no more talking or logic will happen until the body feels safe and the Owl returns."},{"bold_title":"EVALUATE the signal\'s effectiveness","description":"Notice if the frequency of \'explosions\' decreases as both of you become faster at signaling the need for a cooling-off period. **Success Check**: Your son uses the hand signal independently to indicate he needs space before a meltdown occurs."}]},{"title":"Implementing Square Breathing Resets","context":"Teach the \'Trace the Square\' technique as a physical intervention to soothe the Barking Dog and lower the body\'s stress response.","steps":[{"bold_title":"DRAW the breathing square","description":"Have your son draw a square in the air or on his leg to serve as a visual and tactile anchor for the breathing rhythm."},{"bold_title":"SYNC the top line","description":"Invite him to inhale deeply through his nose for a count of four while \'drawing\' the top horizontal line of the square."},{"bold_title":"HOLD the side line","description":"Ask him to hold that breath in for another count of four as he traces the first vertical downward line of the square."},{"bold_title":"RELEASE the bottom line","description":"Direct him to exhale slowly through his mouth for four counts while tracing the bottom horizontal line back across."},{"bold_title":"PAUSE on the final side","description":"Complete the square by holding the lungs empty for four counts while tracing the final vertical line back to the start."},{"bold_title":"REPETITIVE tracing cycles","description":"Encourage him to complete at least three full circles of the square whenever he feels the \'Dog\' starting to growl or pace."},{"bold_title":"VERIFY the physical shift","description":"Check together for signs of relaxation, such as dropped shoulders or a deeper voice, to confirm the physiological reset. **Success

happening right before the Dog started barking: was it a sound, a word, or a difficult task?"},{"bold_title":"AUDIT the biological basics","description":"Investigate the \'HALT\' factors: check if the Dog was extra sensitive because he was Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired."},{"bold_title":"MAP the physical warning","description":"Ask him to describe where he felt the first \'growl\' in his body\u2014his stomach, his chest, or his clenching teeth."},{"bold_title":"BRAINSTORM alternative responses","description":"Think of three things he could do next time the Dog starts pacing, such as drinking water or doing a square breath reset."},{"bold_title":"DOCUMENT the detective findings","description":"Write down the discovery in a \'Detective Log\' so you both remember the pattern for the future and feel like a team."},{"bold_title":"CELEBRATE the shared insight","description":"Affirm his courage for looking at the difficult moment with curiosity rather than shame, building his

out."}]}],"pitfalls":[{"title":"Using Language in Anger","icon":"fa-solid fa-face-angry","text":"Shouting \'Your Dog is barking!\' negates the purpose of the metaphor; it sounds like an accusation and
