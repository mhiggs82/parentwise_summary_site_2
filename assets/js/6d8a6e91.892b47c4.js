She systematically dismantles three pervasive myths: that emotion undermines reason, that difficult emotions harm teens, and that emotional intensity equals psychological fragility. The book provides a neuroscience-grounded, clinically-tested framework that positions intense adolescent emotions as sources of growth, connection, and capability rather than pathology.\\n\\n**Target Outcome**: Parents will develop knowledge and skills to recognize appropriate versus concerning emotional responses, support healthy emotional expression without dismissing or catastrophizing feelings, help teens develop adaptive emotion regulation strategies, distinguish normal developmental turbulence from clinical concerns requiring intervention, and raise emotionally literate, resilient, compassionate adolescents."},"tabs":{"analysis":[{"heading":"1.
