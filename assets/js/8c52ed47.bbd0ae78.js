On one bank is Chaos (loss of control), and on the other is Rigidity (excessive control). Mental health is the ability to stay in the flow between those banks. Integration is the tool that helps children navigate back to the center of the river when they hit either bank."}},{"heading":"2. Horizontal Integration (Left/Right)","intro_text":"The left brain loves logic and order, while the right brain specialized in emotion and nonverbal signals.","insight_card":{"title":"Connect and Redirect","icon":"fa-solid fa-arrows-split-up-and-left","text":"When a child is emotionally flooded, their right brain is in charge. Trying to use left-brain \'logic\' (lectures or arguing) during a flood is like trying to talk to someone who doesn\'t speak your language. You must first connect with their Right brain through empathy and touch before you can redirect them with Left-brain logic."}},{"heading":"3.

When the downstairs brain\'s \'security guard\' (the amygdala) gets triggered, it locks the door to the upstairs brain. Parents must learn to distinguish between \'upstairs tantrums\' (a choice) and \'downstairs tantrums\' (a true loss of control) to respond effectively."}},{"heading":"4.

By helping the child retell the story in a literal, sequential order, you help them move that memory into the left brain\'s logical framework. This \'naming\' of the experience literally calms the amygdala."}},{"heading":"5.
