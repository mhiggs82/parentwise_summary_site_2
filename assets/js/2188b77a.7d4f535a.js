By prioritizing the relationship through respect and autonomy, cooperation becomes a choice the child makes because they feel understood and valued as part of the family team."}},{"heading":"2. The Paradox of Acceptance","intro_text":"Acknowledging that a situation is difficult is often the only way to make it tolerable for a child.","insight_card":{"title":"Validation as Regulation","icon":"fa-solid fa-wave-square","text":"Parents often try to \'fix\' a child\'s feelings by minimizing or distracting (\'You\'re fine!\'). However, dismissed feelings tend to intensify, while acknowledged feelings dissipate. By naming the emotion and describing the situation, you help the child\'s brain regulate itself, allowing them to move from a meltdown back to a state of calm receptivity."}},{"heading":"3.

Descriptive praise\u2014\'I noticed how you kept trying different ways to solve that\'\u2014highlights the effort and strategy.
