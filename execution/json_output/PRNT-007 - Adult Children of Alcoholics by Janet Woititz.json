        "text": "Parental alcoholism is a 'Family Disease' that leaves deep, characteristic imprints on children long after they leave the home. **Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACoAs)** often struggle with guessing at what 'normal' is, lying when the truth is easier, and judging themselves without mercy. Janet Woititz reframes these behaviors not as character flaws, but as adaptive survival mechanisms developed in chaotic environments. By recognizing these 13 common characteristics, adult children can move from unconscious reaction to intentional recovery, breaking the cycle of trauma for themselves and their own children."

Children learn to hyper-vigilantly monitor the alcoholic's mood to ensure their own safety. This creates a baseline of anxiety where the child never learns how to feel 'settled.' As adults, they often carry this 'internal chaos' with them, making it difficult to trust others or even their own perceptions of reality."

Lying wasn't about being 'bad'; it was a way to navigate a parent's unpredictable anger. Being 'super-responsible' was a way to create order in a house where the adults were out of control. Once you see these patterns as survival tools that have outlived their usefulness, the shame dissolves, making room for genuine change."
