By transferring ownership of money, choices, and goals from the parent to the child, you transform them from a passive consumer into an active creator. **The Entitlement Trap** proposes a 'Family Economy' that turns the home into a training ground for the real world. This system ensures children understand the link between effort and reward, allowing them to develop the internal structures needed to resist peer pressure and build authentic self-reliance."
