By prioritizing the marriage as the family's 'heating coil' and utilizing the Five Love Languages to build relationship equity, parents can navigate the unique loyalty binds and power dynamics of stepfamily life. This guide provides a pragmatic roadmap for moving from being 'biological outsiders' to forming a unified and loving family home."
