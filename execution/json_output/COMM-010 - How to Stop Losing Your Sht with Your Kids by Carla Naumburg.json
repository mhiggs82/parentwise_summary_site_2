        "intro_text": "Children are button pushers—it is their job to test boundaries and be immature. Parents own the buttons (exhaustion, hunger, stress, history). Managing the buttons (shrinking them so they are harder to hit) is the parent's work. Blaming the child for pushing a giant, glowing red button is ineffective.",
