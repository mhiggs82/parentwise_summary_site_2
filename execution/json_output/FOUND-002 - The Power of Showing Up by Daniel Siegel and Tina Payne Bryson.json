    "text": "The single most important factor in raising resilient, emotionally healthy children is parental presence—consistently 'showing up' to provide the Four S's: **Safe, Seen, Soothed, and Secure**. This predictable presence creates secure attachment, which is the developmental blueprint for emotional regulation and relationship success. Unlike perfection, true presence involves attunement and the willingness to repair after a conflict. **The Power of Showing Up** proves that even if your own childhood was difficult, your ability to make sense of your history allows you to provide a secure base for your own children."

When you acknowledge a mistake and reconnect—'I'm sorry I lost my cool'—you actually strengthen the attachment. The goal is to be 'predictably present,' allowing for human error followed by relational reconciliation."
