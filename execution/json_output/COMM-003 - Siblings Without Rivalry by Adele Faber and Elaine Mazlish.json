    "text": "**Thesis**: Sibling rivalry stems from children's deep need for exclusive parental love and can be significantly reduced through specific communication skills that acknowledge feelings, avoid comparisons, treat children uniquely rather than equally, free them from rigid roles, and teach constructive conflict resolution.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: The book transforms sibling rivalry from an inevitable family burden into a manageable dynamic. It challenges the \"equality\" myth, proposing that treating children \"fairly\" means treating them uniquely according to need, rather than identically. It also introduces the concept of \"intervention layers,\" teaching parents when to step in and when to step back to foster sibling problem-solving.\n\n**Target Outcome**: Parents gain skills to reduce daily conflict intensity, help children develop their own problem-solving abilities, prevent long-term psychological damage from comparison, and foster sibling relationships that become sources of lifelong support."
