    "text": "**Thesis**: In a digital age, face-to-face conversation is the \"invisible infrastructure\" of secure attachment. By actively cultivating dialogue through fun, low-pressure methods, parents can build bridges of influence that allow them to guide children through life's challenges.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Jurchenko moves beyond generic \"ask your kids questions\" advice by gamifying the process. He pairs 131 specific prompts with engagement mechanics (Jenga, Beach Ball) and concrete \"microskills\" (body language, tone), creating a system that makes conversation play rather than homework.\n\n**Target Outcome**: Families replace screen-induced silence with laughter and discovery, creating a \"safe base\" where children feel seen, heard, and understood (\"in-to-me-see\")."
