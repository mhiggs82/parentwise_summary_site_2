        "text": "In a culture of 'more'—more stuff, more speed, and more entertainment—raising grateful children requires an intentional decision to swim against the current. **Raising Grateful Kids in an Entitled World** argues that saying 'no' to cultural consumerism is the gateway to a 'bigger yes' of character and contentment. By shifting from a 'me-focus' to a 'we-focus' through service and global perspective, parents can help children appreciate what they have rather than resenting what they lack. This guide provides practical tools for building families that value people over possessions and gratitude over greed."
