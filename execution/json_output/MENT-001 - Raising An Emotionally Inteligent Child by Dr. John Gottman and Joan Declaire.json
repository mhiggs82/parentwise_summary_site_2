    "text": "Emotional intelligence (EQ) determines success and happiness more than IQ. **Raising An Emotionally Intelligent Child** introduces 'Emotion Coaching'—the practice of using emotional moments as windows for connection and teaching. Based on decades of laboratory research, John Gottman demonstrates that children whose parents coach them through sadness, anger, and fear develop superior academic performance, stronger relationships, and better physiological self-regulation. By shifting from behavior management to emotional literacy, you create a buffer against stress and give your child the tools to navigate life's complexities with resilience."
