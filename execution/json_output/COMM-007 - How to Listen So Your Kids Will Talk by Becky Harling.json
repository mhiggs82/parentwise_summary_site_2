    "text": "**Thesis**: Effective listening is the cornerstone of strong parent-child relationships and spiritual formation. By listening to understand rather than to correct, parents empower children to become confident, emotionally intelligent adults with lasting connections to their family and God.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Harling integrates biblical wisdom with practical communication techniques. She reframes listening not as passive reception but as an active spiritual practice that mirrors God's attentive love, offering specific tools like the \"Three-Minute Timer\" to restructure family dialogue.\n\n**Target Outcome**: Parents create a culture where children feel heard and valued, leading to stronger attachment, better emotional regulation, and a natural openness to spiritual guidance."
