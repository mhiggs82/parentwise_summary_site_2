    "text": "**Thesis**: Parenting based on \"power-over\" (coercion, rewards, punishment) creates resistance and disconnection. Parenting based on \"power-with\" (collaboration, mutual needs) cultivates intrinsic motivation and deep connection. By using Nonviolent Communication (NVC) principles, parents can resolve conflicts by addressing the underlying needs of both the child and the parent.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Kashtan applies Marshall Rosenberg's NVC framework to the specific power dynamics of the parent-child relationship. She brilliantly reframes \"behavior problems\" as \"tragic expressions of unmet needs\" and offers a roadmap for moving from demand-based parenting to request-based parenting.\n\n**Target Outcome**: A family culture where conflicts are solved collaboratively, children follow rules because they understand the values behind them (not out of fear), and parents model the compassion they wish to see in their children."
