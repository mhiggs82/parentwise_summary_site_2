        "text": "Anxiety disorders thrive on a self-reinforcing cycle of avoidance that keeps a teen's life small and fearful. **The Anxiety Survival Guide for Teens** empowers teens to externalize their anxiety as a 'Monkey Mind'—a well-intentioned but misinformed survival system that constantly screams 'Danger!' when there is none. By using structured Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and graduated exposure ladders, teens can retrain their threat-detection circuitry. The goal is not the total absence of anxiety, but the presence of courage, allowing teens to live according to their values rather than their fears."
