Written by a leading expert in cyber-addiction, this guide provides the technical and psychological strategies needed to win the 'digital arms race' against savvy teens. By controlling the infrastructure and implementing the 24-hour maximum penalty rule, you can restore balance to your home without the constant physical power struggles over devices."

Assess your child across five domains: 1) Social (withdrawing from real friends), 2) Educational (dropping grades), 3) Behavioral (aggression upon removal), 4) Emotional (mood dependent on the game), and 5) Physical (health/sleep). If these domains are declining, your child's 'Tech Diet' is out of balance and requires clinical-level intervention."
