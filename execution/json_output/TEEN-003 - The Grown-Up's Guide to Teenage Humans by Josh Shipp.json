    "text": "Every teenager needs at least one caring adult who sees them as an opportunity rather than a problem. The quality of this relationship—characterized by consistent presence, appropriate boundaries, and developmental understanding—is the single most predictive factor in positive adolescent outcomes. Shipp synthesizes Harvard resilience research with practical field experience to create a phase-based framework that bridges academic research with real-world implementation strategies."

        "heading": "1. From Control to Influence",
        "intro_text": "The transition from 'air traffic controller' to 'coach' represents fundamental reconceptualization of parental authority. Traditional parenting models emphasize compliance and behavioral management, but this approach expires during adolescence when physical control becomes impossible, cognitive development enables sophisticated resistance, and identity formation requires differentiation from parents.",

          "title": "The Coach Model Works",
          "icon": "fa-solid fa-lightbulb",
          "text": "Coaches develop capability in their players. Parents must tolerate short-term chaos for long-term capability development, fundamentally challenging risk-averse parenting culture and allowing teens to fail in low-stakes situations."

        "heading": "2. Testing as Communication",
        "intro_text": "Oppositional behavior serves developmental necessity rather than personal attack. The lap bar metaphor suggests teens push boundaries to confirm stability, not destroy relationships. Adolescent brain development creates genuine uncertainty about relationship permanence and adult reliability.",

          "title": "Testing Confirms Safety",
          "icon": "fa-solid fa-lightbulb",
          "text": "When teens test boundaries, they're asking 'Are you still here for me? Can I trust this relationship?' Parental emotional regulation becomes paramount—the adult's ability to remain non-reactive determines whether teens receive confirmation of safety or evidence of instability."

        "heading": "3. Four Basic Needs Framework",
        "intro_text": "Teens pursue love/belonging, power, freedom, and fun. Misbehavior represents immature attempts to meet legitimate needs. By diagnosing which need drives specific behaviors, validating the need while redirecting the method, and proactively creating healthy outlets, parents transform discipline from punishment to problem-solving.",

          "title": "Diagnose the Need First",
          "icon": "fa-solid fa-lightbulb",
          "text": "Rather than punishing misbehavior, ask 'What legitimate need is driving this?' A teen seeking power through defiance needs real decision-making opportunities. One seeking fun through risky behavior needs exciting appropriate outlets."

        "heading": "4. Humility as Strength",
        "intro_text": "Parental vulnerability and help-seeking function as competence markers rather than weakness indicators. Teens learn relationship skills through observation more than instruction. Parents must actively cultivate support networks before crisis moments, making support infrastructure itself a parenting competency.",
