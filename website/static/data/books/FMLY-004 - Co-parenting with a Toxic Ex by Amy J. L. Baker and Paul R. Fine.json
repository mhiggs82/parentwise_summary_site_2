    "text": "When one parent actively poisons the child against the other, standard co-parenting advice is not only ineffective but can be actively harmful. **Co-parenting with a Toxic Ex** provides a survival manual for parents facing parental alienation, shifting the focus from 'why is the child being mean?' to 'how do I neutralize this manipulation?' By mastering non-defensive communication and staying emotionally present despite active exclusion, you can preserve the long-term bond with your child. This guide is essential for 'targeted parents' who need a 'High-Road' strategy to stay connected when every standard channel is being sabotaged."

Recognizing these as systematic manipulation rather than your child's genuine feelings is the first step toward staying regulated and effective."

          "text": "When an alienated child repeats a toxic lie—'Mom says you stole all the money!'—your instinct is to defend yourself. This fails because it creates a fight that 'proves' the alienator's point. Instead, use active listening to address the child's underlying stress: 'You sound really worried about our family's safety. That's a lot for a kid to worry about.' Addressing the feeling disarms the child's defenses and keeps the connection open."
