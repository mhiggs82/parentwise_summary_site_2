    "text": "The quality of sibling relationships is primarily determined not by children's temperaments or behaviors, but by the parent's approach to discipline, emotional regulation, and connection with each child. Parents who regulate their emotions, maintain warm connections, and coach rather than control raise children who fight less and develop closer lifelong bonds. This work bridges attachment theory, neuroscience, and practical parenting by demonstrating that sibling rivalry is not inevitable destiny but a manageable outcome of parenting choices. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on managing conflict between children, Markham argues the solution lies in transforming the parent-child relationship itself. The book provides specific, actionable strategies for each developmental stage from pregnancy through early childhood. Parents will develop the capacity to remain emotionally regulated during sibling conflicts, help each child feel deeply valued, and teach children emotional intelligence skills that enable them to resolve conflicts independently. The ultimate goal is raising siblings who become friends for life while developing relationship skills applicable to all future interactions."
