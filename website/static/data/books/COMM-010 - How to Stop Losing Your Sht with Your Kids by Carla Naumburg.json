    "text": "**Thesis**: Parental meltdowns (losing your sh\\*t) are predictable nervous system responses to overload, not moral failures. By managing triggers through self-care (\"Button Reduction Practices\") and using simple in-the-moment pauses, parents can regain control and model emotional regulation.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Naumburg demystifies \"losing it\" using the FART acronym (Feelings, Automatic, Reactive, Toxic) and reframes children not as \"triggers\" but as \"button pushers\"—a critical distinction that places responsibility for the *buttons* on the parent. Her tone is humorous, non-judgmental, and deeply practical (\"Do literally anything else\").\n\n**Target Outcome**: Parents move from chronic reactivity and shame to a state of greater calm, where they \"lose it\" less often and repair relationship ruptures more effectively when they do."
