By managing triggers through self-care (\"Button Reduction Practices\") and using simple in-the-moment pauses, parents can regain control and model emotional regulation.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Naumburg demystifies \"losing it\" using the FART acronym (Feelings, Automatic, Reactive, Toxic) and reframes children not as \"triggers\" but as \"button pushers\"—a critical distinction"
