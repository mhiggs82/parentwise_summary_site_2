    "text": "Schools often systematically pathologize children who resist the rigid demands of conformity, labeling them 'troublemakers' rather than human beings in distress. Carla Shalaby's 'Troublemakers' reframes these children as 'canaries in the mine'—sensitive indicators whose noncompliance signals toxic institutional conditions that harm everyone. By shifting from a model of behavioral control to one of 'power sharing' and radical love, educators and parents can transform disruptive behavior into a democratic exercise of freedom. Ultimately, this framework challenges us to stop trying to 'fix' children and start fixing the dehumanizing environments that fail to recognize their full personhood."
