    "text": "Effective parenting begins with the parent's ability to regulate their own emotions, foster deep connection with their child, and coach rather than control behavior—creating children who are emotionally intelligent, self-disciplined, and genuinely happy. This work synthesizes attachment theory, neuroscience, and practical psychology into an actionable framework that addresses the parent's internal state as the primary intervention point. Unlike traditional discipline-focused approaches, Markham positions parental emotional regulation as the foundation for all positive outcomes. Parents who can remain calm under pressure, maintain strong emotional bonds with their children, and guide development through empathic coaching rather than punishment—resulting in cooperative, emotionally healthy children and more peaceful family dynamics."
