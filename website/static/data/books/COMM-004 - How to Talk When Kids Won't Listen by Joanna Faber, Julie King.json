By prioritizing the relationship through respect and autonomy, cooperation becomes a choice the child makes because they feel understood and valued as part of the family team."

By naming the emotion and describing the situation, you help the child's brain regulate itself, allowing them to move from a meltdown back to a state of calm receptivity."

True accountability means living with the natural outcome—like being hungry because they forgot a lunch—and then having the support to 'make it right.'

Descriptive praise—'I noticed how you kept trying different ways to solve that'—highlights the effort and strategy.

When a child feels they have some power over their lives, they are significantly less likely to fight against yours."
