    "text": "**Thesis**: Children become more cooperative, emotionally regulated, and capable of solving problems when adults acknowledge their feelings, engage them respectfully, and involve them in finding solutions—rather than using commands, threats, or punishment.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: This book translates abstract principles into highly specific tools for the modern age, extending the Faber/Mazlish \"How to Talk\" legacy to include digital dilemmas, younger children, and contemporary sensory/behavioral challenges. It creates a scaffolded approach: intellectual grasp -> safe practice -> real-world application.\n\n**Target Outcome**: Parents and educators will reduce daily conflicts (whining, defiance, battles) and strengthen relationships, raising adults who can resolve disputes peacefully and consider others' perspectives."
