    "text": "A father is the primary architect of his daughter's self-image and her expectations of men. **Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters** argues that in a culture of toxic comparison and sexualization, a daughter needs a father who provides 'Benevolent Authority' and protective clarity. By modeling respect, setting firm boundaries on modesty, and staying present during the awkward transitions of puberty, a father becomes a stabilizing anchor. Ultimately, a strong father ensures his daughter knows she is profoundly worthy, protecting her from the need to chase validation in all the wrong places."
