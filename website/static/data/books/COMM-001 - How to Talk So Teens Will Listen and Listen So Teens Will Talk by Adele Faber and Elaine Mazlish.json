        "intro_text": "The fundamental shift from 'making' teenagers behave to creating conditions where they choose responsible behavior. This reframes parental power from coercive to relational. Rather than demanding compliance through threats or rewards, parents learn to create environments and relationships where teens naturally want to cooperate.",

        "intro_text": "Challenges the deeply embedded cultural belief that punishment teaches responsibility. Instead, punishment prevents the internal work necessary for maturity by focusing attention on parental unfairness rather than personal accountability. When teens are punished, they spend energy resenting the punishment rather than reflecting on their choices.",

        "intro_text": "Praising with description rather than evaluation allows teenagers to form their own positive self-assessments rather than depending on external validation or rejecting it as manipulative. Instead of 'You're so smart' (evaluation), say 'You worked through that difficult problem step by step' (description).",

        "intro_text": "Treating teenage emotions as legitimate information rather than problems to be solved or dismissed. This validates their internal experience while maintaining adult boundaries. When parents acknowledge feelings without immediately trying to change them, teens feel understood and are more able to process emotions and move forward.",
