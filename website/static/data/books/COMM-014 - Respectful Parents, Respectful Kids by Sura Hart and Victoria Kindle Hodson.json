    "text": "**Thesis**: Family conflict arises not from bad children or bad parents, but from a \"power-over\" mindset that pits needs against each other. By shifting to a \"power-with\" framework (The No-Fault Zone), families can resolve conflicts by ensuring everyone's needs are identified and valued equally.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Hart and Hodson provide a structured \"operating system\" for the family based on Nonviolent Communication. Their concept of the \"No-Fault Zone\" helps meaningful visual and spatial anchor for conflict resolution. They emphasize that respect is a two-way street: parents cannot demand respect without modeling it.\n\n**Target Outcome**: A democratic family culture characterized by emotional safety, where conflicts are solved through \"co-operation\" (operating together) rather than coercion or compromise."
