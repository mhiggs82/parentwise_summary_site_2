    "text": "Childhood anxiety is often unintentionally strengthened by parents who provide excessive reassurance and accommodate their child's avoidance. **Anxious Kids, Anxious Parents** presents a counterintuitive shift: families must move from eliminating comfort to actively seeking discomfort. By externalizing 'Worry' as a separate entity and using structured experiments to test the brain's alarm system, parents can transform their homes from places of overprotection to training grounds for courage. The goal is to raise independent children who don't avoid life's uncertainties, but instead confidently say, 'I'm willing to be uncomfortable for what I want.'"
