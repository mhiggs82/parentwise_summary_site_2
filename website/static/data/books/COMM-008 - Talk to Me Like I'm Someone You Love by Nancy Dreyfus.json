    "text": "**Thesis**: Relationship ruptures are often \"context failures\"—how we treat each other—rather than \"content disputes.\" These can be rapidly repaired by shifting from defensive verbal arguing to vulnerable written messages (flash cards) that bypass emotional flooding and re-establish safety.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Dreyfus introduces a tangible tool—127 pre-written messages (\"flash cards\")—that partners can physically hold up or hand over during conflict. This method neutralizes toxic tone of voice, slows down reactivity, and provides the \"perfect words\" when stress makes them impossible to find.\n\n**Target Outcome**: Partners transform toxic conflicts into moments of intimacy by bypassing the amygdala hijack/defensiveness loop. The goal is not just to stop fighting, but to use conflict as a doorway to deeper vulnerability and trust."
