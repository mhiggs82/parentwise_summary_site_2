    "text": "Digital dependency is a biological habit fueled by dopamine, and breaking it requires a systematic, graduated approach rather than sudden removal. **Unplug Your Kids from the Digital World** advocates for a 'ramp-down' protocol that respects the child's brain chemistry while replacing screens with direct parental connection. By utilizing 'Love and Logic' principles—emphasizing empathy and natural consequences—you can transition your home from digital isolation to real-world engagement. This guide provides the tactical countdowns and behavioral frameworks needed to eliminate transition tantrums and protect the sleep sanctity of your child's bedroom."

Yao suggests a graduated reduction of just 15 minutes per week. This 'slow-fade' protocol feels manageable to the child but adds up to hours of reclaimed real-world time over a single month, allowing the brain's baseline to reset without war."
