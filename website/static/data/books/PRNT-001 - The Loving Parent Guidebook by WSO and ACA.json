    "text": "**Thesis:** The solution to recovery from family dysfunction is to become one's own loving parent through reparenting—a systematic practice of nurturing, protecting, supporting, and guiding one's inner family members (inner child, inner teenager, critical parent) with gentleness, humor, love, and respect.\n\n**Unique Contribution:** This guidebook operationalizes ACA's core principle by providing concrete, actionable reparenting tools grounded in attachment theory, trauma-informed practice, and 12-Step principles. It bridges the gap between intellectual understanding of dysfunction and embodied healing through daily practices.\n\n**Target Outcome:** Readers will develop a functional inner loving parent capable of meeting their inner children's core needs, thereby reducing reliance on survival traits, breaking intergenerational dysfunction, and living as \"actors\" rather than \"reactors\" to life circumstances."
