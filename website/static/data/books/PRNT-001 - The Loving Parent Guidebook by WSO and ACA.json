This shifts the paradigm from trying to eliminate dysfunction to loving it into healing, recognizing that inner family members have positive intentions even when their methods are problematic.",

The inner child holds wounds from childhood and needs protection, nurturance, support, and guidance. The critical parent tries to protect through harsh judgment and control. The loving parent learns to lead this internal system with compassion and wisdom.",

Actual feelings are emotional states tied to unmet needs: 'I feel hurt/scared/angry.' This distinction shifts focus from blame to self-responsibility. When you say 'I feel abandoned,' you make others responsible for your emotional state. When you say 'I feel lonely because I need connection,' you identify the actual feeling and the need you can address.",

False beliefs like 'I'm not good enough' or 'There's something wrong with me' feel like truth but are protective conclusions children made to survive abandonment. Releasing them requires compassion for the child who formed them, offering new loving truths, and ritual release.",
