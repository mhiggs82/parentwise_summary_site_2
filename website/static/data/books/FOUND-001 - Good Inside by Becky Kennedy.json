    "text": "Children are fundamentally good inside, and challenging behaviors are signals of unmet needs rather than character flaws. **Good Inside** rejects traditional behaviorist approaches like time-outs and rewards in favor of connection and sturdy boundaries. By learning to hold multiple truths simultaneously—validating a child's feelings while maintaining safe limits—parents can build secure attachments that wire children for lifelong resilience. This guide transforms parenting from a battle of wills into a collaborative process of emotional regulation and mutual respect."
