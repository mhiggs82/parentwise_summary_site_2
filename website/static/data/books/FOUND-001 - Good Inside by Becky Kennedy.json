    "text": "**Thesis**: Children are fundamentally good inside, and challenging behaviors are expressions of unmet needs rather than character flaws. Effective parenting requires understanding the emotional world beneath surface behaviors while maintaining firm boundaries through connection rather than punishment.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Dr. Becky Kennedy bridges attachment theory, internal family systems (IFS), and neuroscience into an accessible framework that rejects behaviorist approaches (time-outs, rewards, punishments) while maintaining parental authority. She demonstrates that firm boundaries and warm validation are complementary, not oppositional forces.\n\n**Target Outcome**: Parents develop the capacity to regulate themselves, understand their children's internal experiences, set sturdy boundaries, and build secure attachments that wire children for lifelong emotional resilience and healthy relationships."

Kennedy reframes behavior as communication about internal struggle, shifting intervention from suppression to understanding. This paradigm shift requires parents to look beneath surface actions to identify unmet needs, developmental limitations, or emotional dysregulation. When parents respond to the underlying need rather than punishing the behavior, children learn that their feelings are manageable and that they remain lovable even during difficult moments.",
