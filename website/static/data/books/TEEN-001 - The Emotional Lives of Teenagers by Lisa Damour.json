    "text": "**Thesis**: Adolescent mental health is not about feeling good, but about having the right feelings at the right time and being able to manage those feelings effectively through both expression and control.\n\n**Unique Contribution**: Damour reframes teenage emotionality from a problem to be solved into a developmental feature to be understood and managed. She systematically dismantles three pervasive myths: that emotion undermines reason, that difficult emotions harm teens, and that emotional intensity equals psychological fragility. The book provides a neuroscience-grounded, clinically-tested framework that positions intense adolescent emotions as sources of growth, connection, and capability rather than pathology.\n\n**Target Outcome**: Parents will develop knowledge and skills to recognize appropriate versus concerning emotional responses, support healthy emotional expression without dismissing or catastrophizing feelings, help teens develop adaptive emotion regulation strategies, distinguish normal developmental turbulence from clinical concerns requiring intervention, and raise emotionally literate, resilient, compassionate adolescents."

This prevents both emotional suppression (trying to control without expressing) and emotional flooding (expressing without ever developing control). The framework provides a clear decision tree: when teens show distress, first facilitate expression through listening, empathy, and validation. Only move to control strategies if expression doesn't provide sufficient relief. Different situations call for different approaches—expression for grief, control for test anxiety.",

Moving from \"I feel bad\" to \"I feel disappointed and somewhat resentful\" enhances emotional management because specificity activates different neural pathways and provides clearer direction for response. \"Anxious\" might call for breathing exercises, while \"frustrated\" might call for problem-solving. Parents should gently probe when teens use vague terms, offering more precise alternatives without correcting, and model emotional granularity in their own speech.",
