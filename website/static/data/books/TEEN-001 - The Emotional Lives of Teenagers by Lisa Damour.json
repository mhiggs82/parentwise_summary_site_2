She systematically dismantles myths about adolescent emotions and provides a neuroscience-grounded framework that positions intense feelings as sources of growth, connection, and capability rather than pathology."

        "heading": "1. The Two-Part Emotion Regulation Framework",
        "intro_text": "Healthy emotion management requires both expression (finding outlets for feelings) and control (reining in feelings when necessary), with expression always attempted first. This prevents both emotional suppression (trying to control without expressing) and emotional flooding (expressing without ever developing control). The framework provides a clear decision tree: when teens show distress, first facilitate expression through listening, empathy, and validation. Only move to control strategies if expression doesn't provide sufficient relief.",

        "intro_text": "The more precisely teens can name their feelings, the better they can regulate them. Moving from 'I feel bad' to 'I feel disappointed and somewhat resentful' enhances emotional management because specificity activates different neural pathways and provides clearer direction for response. 'Anxious' might call for breathing exercises, while 'frustrated' might call for problem-solving.",

This provides clear criteria for distinguishing normal adolescent turbulence from clinical concerns. Ask: Does this feeling make sense given what happened? Is the intensity proportional? Can they still function? Are they managing it adaptively?",

        "intro_text": "Boys and girls face systematically different emotional socialization that creates different vulnerabilities requiring different interventions. Boys need help expressing vulnerability through safe spaces, indirect approaches (car conversations, texting), and male role models demonstrating emotional expression. Girls need validation that anger is legitimate, constructive outlets for anger expression, and boundaries on co-rumination.",
