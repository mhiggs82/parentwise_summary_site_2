# Section 1: Analysis & Insights

## Executive Summary
**Thesis**: Mobility is not just "hard"; it is a massive neurobiological drain. Ota argues that when students/families move, they lose their "Social Baseline" (the people who regulate their nervous system). This makes everything feel harder (hills look steeper, backpacks feel heavier). Schools must treat "Transitions" as *infrastructure*—like plumbing or electricity—not just "nice-to-have" counseling.

**Unique Contribution**: Ota connects **Neuroscience** to **Mobility**. He explains *why* the brain stops learning during a move (the Anterior Cingulate Cortex is on fire with grief/threat). He also introduces the concept of the "Attachment Commons"—if one school ignores transitions, it pollutes the trust-capacity of the student for the next school.

**Target Outcome**: A school system and family culture where "Goodbyes" are mandatory and structured, so that "Hellos" can actually stick.

## Chapter Breakdown
- **The Brain**: Why mobility looks like trauma to the prefrontal cortex.
- **The Cliff**: The rupture of the life story.
- **The School**: Why institutions must lead (individual parents can't solve systemic mobility).
- **The Practice**: How to build a Transition Team.

## Nuanced Main Topics

### The Psychological Cliff
When you move, you lose the "Audience" of your life story. You fall off the "Narrative Cliff." Ota argues that unless you bridge this gap (by maintaining connections, telling the story), the child loses their sense of Self. Identity is relational; when relations are severed, identity is threatened.

### Social Baseline Theory (Coan)
This is the scientific backing. Humans are designed to "outsource" cognitive load to trusted others. When you have a friend, the hill looks less steep. When you move, you lose your outsourcers. You have to carry the full cognitive load alone. This causes "Transition Fatigue."

### The "Attachment Commons"
Students circulate through the international school system. Their ability to trust (attach) is a shared resource. If School A handles a departure badly (no goodbye), the student arrives at School B with a "damaged" attachment system (guarded, cynical). School A has polluted the commons for School B.

# Section 2: Actionable Framework

## The Checklist
- [ ] **The "RAFT" Implementation**: Is the family building a RAFT (Reconciliation, Affirmation, Farewells, Think Destination)?
- [ ] **Timing**: Are goodbyes starting *before* the packing? (Spring, not Summer).
- [ ] **The Life Story Book**: Is there a physical record of the "Old Life" to carry to the "New Life"?
- [ ] **Social Baseline Restoration**: Is the priority in Week 1 finding *one* trusted friend/adult?

## Implementation Steps (Process)

### Process 1: The "Goodbye" Protocol
**Purpose**: Close the loop to save the brain.

**Steps**:
1.  **List**: Who do we need to say goodbye to? (People, Places, Pets).
2.  **Act**: Schedule the coffee/playdate.
3.  **Say**: "I am leaving. You mattered to me. Thank you." (This prevents "Vaporizing").

### Process 2: The "Bridge" Building
**Purpose**: Prevent the Psychological Cliff.

**Steps**:
1.  **Pre-Move**: Contact the new school/community. Get a name/face.
2.  **During**: Keep the "Old" alive. Don't say "Forget them." Schedule the Skype call for Week 2.
3.  **Narrate**: "You are the same person who loved pizza in Tokyo, now eating pizza in London."

### Process 3: The "Oxygen Mask" for Parents
**Purpose**: Restore the regulator.

**Steps**:
1.  **Acknowledge**: "I am brain-tired because I have no Social Baseline here."
2.  **Connect**: Find one other adult to talk to honestly (not just superficial expat chat).
3.  **Grace**: Lower expectations for academic/work performance for 6 months.

## Common Pitfalls
- **The "Clean Break" Myth**: Thinking it's better to just cut ties and move on. (Causes attachment trauma).
- **The "Resilience" Bypass**: Saying "Kids are resilient" to avoid doing the hard work of grief.
- **The "Honeymoon" Trap**: Thinking because the kid is excited, they aren't also grieving. (The crash comes later).
