    "text": "Middle school doesn't have to be a dreaded phase—by understanding adolescent brain development and shifting parenting approaches from 'fixing' to 'coaching,' parents can help children navigate this critical period while maintaining positive relationships. Icard bridges neuroscience research with practical, scenario-based guidance, reframing middle school as an opportunity rather than an ordeal. She provides concrete tools for supporting your child's construction of three critical elements: a mature body, a developed brain, and an independent identity. The goal is to transform parents from problem-solvers into coaches who build their child's capability while maintaining open communication."
