    "text": "Effective co-parenting is an 'inside-out' process that begins with mastering your own reactions rather than trying to control your ex-partner. **Co-Parenting from the Inside Out** argues that by treating the relationship as a professional business partnership, you can shield your children from the toxicity of adult conflict. By focusing on self-regulation, grieving the past independently, and accepting the reality of 'different houses,' you empower your children to love both parents freely. This guide provides the emotional and tactical tools to move from a state of reactive crisis to a stable, child-centered co-parenting environment."

In a business partnership, you are polite, brief, and strictly focused on the 'client' (the child). This professional distance prevents you from regressing into old marital arguments and keeps the focus on the logistics of raising healthy children."
