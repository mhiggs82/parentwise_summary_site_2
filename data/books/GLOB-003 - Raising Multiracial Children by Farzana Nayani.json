    "text": "Multiracial children navigate a world that often demands they choose a single box, leading to a profound sense of 'not being enough' for any of their constituent heritages. **Raising Multiracial Children** rejects the 'colorblind' approach, arguing that parents must proactively provide their children with the racial literacy and emotional armor needed to define themselves on their own terms. By utilizing the CHATS framework and the Conscious Cultivation of Identity (CCI) model, families can transform the invasive 'What are you?' question into a source of personal agency. This guide offers a definitive roadmap for building 'Cultural Citizenship' in every strand of a child's heritage, ensuring they feel whole rather than fractured."

To build a healthy self-image, children need parents who explicitly see and celebrate their racial complexity. Active racial literacy training at home—naming race, discussing history, and acknowledging systemic bias—is the only way to ensure the child doesn't feel invisible or 'erased' in their own family."
