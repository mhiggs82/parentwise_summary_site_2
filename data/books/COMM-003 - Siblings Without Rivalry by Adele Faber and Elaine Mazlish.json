    "text": "Sibling rivalry is not an inevitable family burden but a manageable dynamic driven by a child's deep need for exclusive parental love. **Siblings Without Rivalry** reveals that treating children 'equally' is a myth that actually increases competition. By moving toward 'unique recognition' and teaching graduated conflict-resolution skills, parents can transform the sibling relationship from a source of friction into a lifelong bond of support. This guide provides the tools to de-escalate daily battles and free children from the restrictive roles that often define family life."

This creates a scarcity mentality. By giving according to individual need ('You need new shoes; your brother doesn't') and acknowledging unique traits, you create a sense of abundance and security that reduces the need for constant comparison."

          "text": "When a child says 'I hate my brother,' the parental instinct is to correct them ('No you don't!'). This denial of feeling makes the child feel even more misunderstood and resentful. Acknowledging the feeling—'Sometimes you feel really frustrated living with him'—allows the emotional charge to drop. Only when a child feels their 'case' is heard can they consider a win-win solution."

Unfavorable comparisons are even more damaging. The skill is to describe only the behavior you see in front of you without referencing the other child at all.

To free a child, parents must aggressively notice and describe behavior that contradicts their 'assigned' role.

By acting as a facilitator—acknowledging both sides' feelings and then leaving the room—you force the children to develop the negotiation and compromise skills they will need for their entire lives."
