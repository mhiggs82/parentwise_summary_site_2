    "text": "Modern society faces a fundamental crisis where children increasingly orient toward peers rather than parents, undermining healthy development and parental authority. This peer orientation represents a reversal of natural attachment hierarchies, creating immature, anxious children who lack the developmental foundation necessary for becoming independent adults. The book introduces \"peer orientation\" as a diagnostic framework for understanding contemporary parenting challenges. Unlike approaches that blame permissive parenting or insufficient discipline, this work identifies attachment displacement as the root cause. Children need deep, secure attachment to adults—not socialization with peers—as the foundation for maturation. Restore parent-child attachment bonds to their natural primacy, enabling parents to reclaim their role as the primary influence in their children's lives. This restoration allows children to develop authentic independence, emotional resilience, and the capacity for genuine relationships rather than peer-dependent conformity."
