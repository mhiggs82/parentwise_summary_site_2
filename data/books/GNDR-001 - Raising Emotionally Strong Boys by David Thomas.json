    "text": "Boys are often socialized to suppress vulnerable emotions like fear and sadness, leading to 'The Anger Funnel' where aggression becomes their only acceptable outlet. David Thomas argues that raising emotionally strong boys requires a shift from viewing feelings as problems to be fixed to seeing them as muscles that need targeted exercise. By providing physical 'regulation stations' and utilizing side-by-side connection, parents can help boys develop the vocabulary and composure needed for true maturity. Ultimately, this framework ensures that boys grow into men who see vulnerability not as a weakness, but as the ultimate act of courage and strength."
