By focusing on the *process* of how children think—rather than just the *content* of what they know—parents can equip children with the 'air traffic control system' needed to navigate a complex, distracting world with focus and resilience."

EF allow us to focus, hold information in mind, and shift our thinking as needed. Galinsky argues that these skills are like a muscle: they are not fixed at birth and can be systematically strengthened through specific types of play and interaction."

Children build this cognitive flexibility by engaging in activities that require them to 'stop, think, and act' rather than just reacting to every impulse. Protecting a child's focus by limiting background stimulation (like irrelevant TV) is critical for neural development."

Perspective taking is a cognitive skill that allows children to predict others' behavior and resolve conflicts logically. It is the ultimate antidote to aggression and social isolation, as it enables a child to see the 'why' behind someone else's actions even when they disagree with them."

Children who are protected from all struggle never develop the neural pathways for managing frustration. By reframing challenge as a necessary 'workout' for the brain, parents can help children view mistakes not as failures, but as data points for their next strategic attempt."
